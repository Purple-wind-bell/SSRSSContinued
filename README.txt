**Change Log:**

* Update for latest scatterer v0.0320b
* Few more fixes for RSS and 1.3
* Removed Volumetric clouds on Venus and Titan until Scatterer can fix its black cloud issue
* New sun flare
* Added sun light intensity curve (bodies get darker as they get further from the sun)
  * If you don't like it, or think its too dark, just delete the SunCurve.cfg in SSRSS/configs
